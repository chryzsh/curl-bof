# curl-bof

curl-bof is a basic implementation of `curl` designed to peek at remote services without opening a SOCKS proxy. It enables operators to fetch TLS certificates, response headers, and HTML titles from remote web services, making it useful for reconnaissance, fingerprinting, and monitoring certificate changes for potential interception.

## Overview

`curl-bof` provides two main functionalities:

- **finger** → Retrieve **TLS certificates**, response headers, and the HTML `<title>` from a URL.
- **print** → Fetch and print the raw page content (basically CURL).

### **Basic Usage**
```plaintext
beacon> curl-bof <finger|print> <url> [--ua "Custom User-Agent"]
```

Finger Output:
```plaintext
beacon> curl-bof finger https://example.com
